This raylib project template for CMake uses code from the CMakeLists.txt example [1], the
cmake.yml workflow file [2] and the window scale letterbox example [3] provided in the
raylib source code licenced under the zlib license. The template also includes the
VisualStudio.gitignore [4] file from GitHub's gitignore repository licenced under
the CC0-1.0 License. The Doxygen integration for CMake comes from a blog post by
Victoria Rudakova [5]. The doxygen theme used is doxygen-awesome-css by
jothepro [6] which is available under the MIT license.
